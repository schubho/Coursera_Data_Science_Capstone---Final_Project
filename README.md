### Coursera Data Science Capstone: FinalProject.

Mumbai Neighborhoods Project Summary:

Kabir lives in the city of Mumbai, India. He has recently changed his job, and his new office is located almost 20 kms away from his home. This means his daily travel time is close to 3 to 4 hours, and he sees this as a waste of time and resources. Kabir wants to move closer to his office. He currently stays in the neighbourhood of Tardeo, which is in South Mumbai. And his office is in Andheri, which is in north Mumbai. He doesn’t wish to stay in Andheri because it is a commercial neighbourhood, but needs to move top a neighbourhood closer to his workplace. Kabir has shortlisted 5 neighbourhoods that he wishes to explore. He likes his current neighbourhood and the mix of lifestyle options it presents, and hopes to move to one that is similar in character and composition to his current neighbourhood of Tardeo.

The problem we are looking to solve: Which Mumbai neighbourhoods in his shortlist or otherwise come close to his current neighbourhood of Tardeo, in terms of their composition and character? While this particular problem is specific to Kabir’s requirement, the solution needs to cater to other similar cases which require segmenting Mumbai neighbourhoods based on broad lifestyle options.

Skills: Clustering, and Web Scraping and using the Foursquare API to get location data.
